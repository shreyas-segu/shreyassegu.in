  <h1>Hey, I'm Shreyas!</h1>
  <p>
    I'm a software engineer who loves building systems, writing clean code, and
    spending an unhealthy amount of time automating things that don't really
    need automating. If a task takes 2 minutes manually, I'll happily burn an
    entire evening scripting it, not because it's efficient, but because I can
    (and because cron jobs spark more joy than spreadsheets ever will).
  </p>
  <p>
    I have a long list of side projects, most of them half-finished, some
    abandoned, and a few I'm still pretending I'll complete "soon." I care about
    good architecture, dev tools, and backend systems that scale without
    becoming a dumpster fire. I've been down the rabbit hole of Linux servers,
    self-hosting, homelabbing, and breaking my local network more times than I'd
    like to admit.
  </p>
  <p>
    Outside of tech, I'm usually off exploring offbeat places with friends,
    binging anime, or fiddling with computer hardware I don't need but somehow
    convince myself I do.
  </p>
  <p>
    This blog is where I dump my thoughts, tech notes, rants, ideas, things I've
    learnt (or broken), and maybe the occasional project that actually made it
    past version 0.1. If that sounds like your kind of chaos, you're in the
    right place.
